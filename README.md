Please directly follow the steps in  `Instructions.md` to replicate the results in the project. This file include steps of uploading certain code files and those files can be found in the below folders:

`ana_code`: contains code for analytics

`etl_code`: contains code for data cleaning

As the datasets are too large to store in github, instructions to download them are listed in the `Instructions.md`
